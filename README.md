Useful terminal commands for git and other sofware tools and programs.

## Usage

Point your favorite web browser to this simple and fine [repository](https://github.com/miljanuscumlic/terminal-commands) :) and browse through its files while you are building the software at your work or for the fun, hopefully both at the same time. ;)

Every file containing terminal commands has a header:

   | Command | Description | Note | Version | Docs |
   |:--- |:--- |:--- |:--- |:--- |

In the best case scenario **Version** column should contain the software version that introduced the particular command. Inspite of that it may and usually does contain the earliest known version in which the command is tested to work.<br />
**Docs** column contains the official documentation link describing the command in question.
